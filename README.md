# ToDo App (but in Rust this time)
As the title says, this is a ToDo app (but in Rust).
Anyways, I think it's pretty cool. I'm having a lot of fun building it.

# Basic Instructions
## Use the ```--help``` command
The ```--help``` command is really useful. Basically anything you want to learn
about the program, you can understand from it.

Note that ```--help``` can also be used on sub-commands as well.
